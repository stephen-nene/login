Your daily schedule using the Pomodoro technique is well-structured, but there are ways to enhance it further by adapting techniques that help balance focus on high-priority tasks like the web design project while accommodating flexibility for other tasks that require attention, such as the WhatsApp bot and ad hoc assignments. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Task Batching with Time Blocking**: Group similar tasks to minimize context-switching. This technique could be used alongside the Pomodoro blocks, ensuring high-focus periods are dedicated to similar types of work.
2. **Peak Productivity Hours**: Schedule your most demanding tasks during your peak productivity times (often the first few hours of your workday).
3. **Buffer Periods**: Set aside buffer periods before and after your main tasks to allow transition time, helping avoid mental fatigue and improving focus.

Here's an optimized approach:

| *Time*          | *Task*                                             | *Duration*   | *Notes*                                   |

| **1:00 PM - 2:00 PM**   | Lunch Break                                 | 1 hr           | Long lunch break.                         |
| **2:00 PM - 2:45 PM**   | Assignments/Study (Pomodoro 1 & 2)         | 45 min         | Focus on assignments and studies.         |
| **2:45 PM - 2:55 PM**   | Break                                       | 10 min         | Short break.                              |
| **2:55 PM - 3:30 PM**   | Task1 (Ad hoc task)                         | 35 min         | Attend to any other high-priority task.   |
| **3:30 PM - 3:35 PM**   | Break                                       | 5 min          | Short break.                              |

| **4:30 PM - 5:00 PM**   | Review & Wrap-Up                            | 30 min         | Reflect on the day and prepare for tomorrow.|

By using **two-block Pomodoros (50 min each)**, this schedule increases focus periods for deep work on the web design project, maximizes morning energy for high-priority tasks, and keeps the later day flexible for bot documentation, assignments, and unexpected tasks.
